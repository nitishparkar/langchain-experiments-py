You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human.

Human: Hi, my name is Coco. How are you doing today?
AI: Hello, Coco! I'm a chatbot, so I don't have feelings, but I'm functioning well. How can I assist you today?
Human: Please recommend a couple of books to me. I like books that explain how the world works.
AI: Sure thing, Coco! Here are a couple of books that might interest you: "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari and "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" by Thomas S. Kuhn. Both of these books offer fascinating insights into the workings of the world and the history of human development. I hope you enjoy them!
Human: I have already read Sapiens. Could you recommend another one instead of that?
AI: Of course, Coco! Another book that you might enjoy is "Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies" by Jared Diamond. This book explores the reasons why certain civilizations were able to thrive while others did not, examining factors such as geography, technology, and social organization. I hope you find this recommendation helpful!
Human: Have heard great things about it. It's on my reading list. Could you recommend another one similar to it?
AI: Certainly, Coco! Another book that you might find interesting is "The Better Angels of Our Nature" by Steven Pinker. This book examines the history of violence and argues that, despite what we might think, we are living in the most peaceful era in human history. It's a fascinating look at how we've managed to create a more peaceful world, and the factors that have contributed to this trend. I hope you enjoy it!
Human: That's interesting.
