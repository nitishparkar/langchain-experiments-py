You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human.

Human: Hi, my name is Coco. How are you doing today?
AI: Hello, Coco! I'm a chatbot, so I don't have feelings, but I'm functioning well. How can I assist you today?
Human: Please recommend a couple of books to me. I like books that explain how the world works.
AI: Sure thing, Coco! Here are a couple of books that might interest you: "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari and "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" by Thomas S. Kuhn. Both of these books offer fascinating insights into the workings of the world and the history of human development. I hope you enjoy them!
Human: I have already read Sapiens. Could you recommend another one instead of that?
AI: Of course, Coco! Another book that you might enjoy is "Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies" by Jared Diamond. This book explores the reasons why certain civilizations were able to thrive while others did not, examining factors such as geography, technology, and social organization. I hope you find this recommendation helpful!
Human: Have heard great things about it. It's on my reading list. Could you recommend another one similar to it?
AI: Certainly, Coco! Another book that you might find interesting is "The Better Angels of Our Nature" by Steven Pinker. This book examines the history of violence and argues that, despite what we might think, we are living in the most peaceful era in human history. It's a fascinating look at how we've managed to create a more peaceful world, and the factors that have contributed to this trend. I hope you enjoy it!
Human: That's interesting.

## Example 2 (Loss of information in the summary)

Conversation through prompts:

You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human.

Human: Could you please recommend a trek for me? It should be near Mumbai
AI: Sure, there are many great trekking options near Mumbai. One of the most popular is the Rajmachi trek, which offers stunning views of the Sahyadri mountains and takes you through lush green forests. Another option is the Kalsubai trek, which is the highest peak in the Sahyadri range and offers breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding valleys. Both treks are easily accessible from Mumbai and are perfect for adventure enthusiasts.
Human: I have done both. Couple of more options please.
AI: Sure, you might want to try the Harishchandragad trek, which is known for its rugged terrain and ancient temples, or the Lohagad trek, which takes you through scenic trails and offers stunning views of the surrounding landscape. Another option is the Tung Fort trek, which is a relatively easy trek and offers beautiful views of the Pawna Lake. All of these treks are located near Mumbai and offer a great experience for anyone looking for adventure and natural beauty.
Human: Is it advisable to do those treks in May?
AI: May can be quite hot and humid in Mumbai, so it may not be the ideal time to go trekking. It's important to check the weather conditions before embarking on any trek, as heavy rainfall during the monsoon season can make the trails slippery and dangerous. If you do decide to go trekking in May, be sure to carry plenty of water and sunscreen, and wear lightweight, comfortable clothing. It's also a good idea to start early in the morning to avoid hiking during the hottest parts of the day.
Human: What's the best season then?
AI: The best season for trekking near Mumbai is generally between October to March, when the weather is cool and pleasant. The trails are usually dry and the skies are clear, making it easier to enjoy the scenic views. However, it's always a good idea to check the weather forecast before planning any trek, as unexpected rains or storms can occur at any time.
Human: Thanks. Will go in November then.
